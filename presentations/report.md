# Overview

We applied a basic linear model (Astin, 1997) including four variables (high school GPA, SAT scores, gender, race) to predict student graduation rates and compare our historical rates to expected results.

## Model Selection

Our model was chosen for the following reasons:

- Data availability - The model uses four easily available variables
- Simplicity - Easy to apply linear model
- Large sample size (n=53k)
